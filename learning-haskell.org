* Learning Haskell

Testing the Notebook:
#+begin_src haskell
putStrLn "Hello, world!"
#+end_src

** Conditionals

If must always have an else.

Instead of If-Else, we can use Guardaded Equations:
#+begin_src haskell
abs n | n >= 0    = n
      | otherwise = -n
#+end_src

Wildcard Pattern: `n` means 'anything'.

** List Patterns

"Cons", "(:)", is an operator that constructs a list.
#+begin_src haskell
head :: [a] -> a
head (x:_) = x
  
tail :: [a] -> [a]
tail (_:xs) = xs
#+end_src

** Lambda Expressions

#+begin_src haskell
\x -> x + x
#+end_src

Can be used to understand *currying*.

For example, instead of writing:
#+begin_src haskell
add :: Int -> Int -> Int
add x y = x + y
#+end_src

We can write:
#+begin_src haskell
add :: Int -> (Int -> Int)
add = \x -> (\y -> x + y)
#+end_src

It's a good practice to use lambda expressions for functions that only appear once.
#+begin_src haskell
odds n = map f [0..n-1]
         where
           f x = x*2 + 1
#+end_src
where `map` applies the function across all the list.

Instead of that
#+begin_src haskell
odds n = map (\x -> x*2 + 1) [0..n-1]
#+end_src

Also, we can create *operators sections*:
#+begin_src haskell
(1+) 2
(1/) 2
(*2) 2
(/2) 2
#+end_src

** List Comprehension

Takes all xs from 1 to 5 and square them.
#+begin_src haskell
[x^2 | x <- [1..5]]
#+end_src

The expression `[1..5]` is called a *generator*.

Cartesian product between $\{1,2,3\}$ and $\{4,5\}$:
#+begin_src haskell
[(x,y) | y <- [4,5], x <- [1,2,3]]
#+end_src

We can use *guards* to restrict the values (like a 'such that').

Example: factors of an integer.
#+begin_src haskell
factors :: Int -> [Int]  
factors n = [x | x <- [1..n], n `mod` x == 0]
#+end_src

Which we can use to check if a number is prime.
#+begin_src haskell
prime :: Int -> Bool
prime n = factors n == [1,n]
#+end_src

And then find the first n primes.
#+begin_src haskell
primes :: Int -> [Int]
prime n = [x | x <- [2..n], prime x]
#+end_src

** Zip Function

#+begin_src haskell
zip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a,b)]
  
pairs :: [a] -> [(a,a)]
pairs xs = zip xs (tail xs)  
    
sorted :: Ord a => [a] -> Bool
sorted xs = and [x <= y | (x,y) <- pairs xs]

positions :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> [Int]
positions x xs = [i | (x',i) <- zip xs [0..], x == x']
#+end_src

** String Comprehensions
  
#+begin_src haskell
count :: Char -> String -> Int
count x xs = length [x' | x' <- xs, x == x']
#+end_src

Scalar product:
#+begin_src haskell
sp :: [Int] -> [Int] -> Int
sp xs ys = sum [xs !! i * ys !! i | i <- [0..n-1]]
             where n = length xs
  
sp xs ys = sum [x * y | (x,y) <- zip xs ys]    
#+end_src

* Recursive Functions

Simple definition of factorial:
#+begin_src haskell
fac :: Int -> Int
fac n = product [1..n]
#+end_src

Recursively, we define a *base case* and a *recursive case*.
#+begin_src haskell
fac 0 = 1 
fac n = n * fac (n-1)
#+end_src

** Recursion on Lists

#+begin_src haskell
product :: Num a => [a] -> a
product []     = 1
product (n:ns) = n * product ns
#+end_src

#+begin_src haskell
length :: [a] -> Int
length []     = 0
length (_:xs) = 1 + length xs
#+end_src

#+begin_src haskell
reverse :: [a] -> [a]
reverse []     = []
reverse (x:xs) = reverse xs ++ [x]
#+end_src

** Multiple Arguments

#+begin_src haskell
zip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a,b)]
zip []     _      = []
zip _      []     = []
zip (x:xs) (y:ys) = (x,y) : zip xs ys
#+end_src

** Quicksort

#+begin_src haskell
qsort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
qsort []     = []  
qsort (x:xs) =
  qsort smaller ++ [x] ++ qsort larger
  where
    smaller = [a | a <- xs, a <= x]
    larger  = [b | b <- xs, b > x]
#+end_src

* Higher-Order Functions

*Definition:* Takes a function as an argument or returns a function as a result.
E.g.
#+begin_src haskell
twice :: (a -> a) -> a -> a
twice f x = f (f x)
#+end_src

** The Map Function

Applies a function to every element of a list.
#+begin_src haskell
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map f xs = [f x | x <- xs]
#+end_src

** The Filter Function
Selects every element from a list that satisfies a predicate.
#+begin_src haskell
filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
filter p xs = [x | x <- xs, p x]
#+end_src

Another way of defining it:
#+begin_src haskell
filter p [] = []
filter p (x:xs)
  | p x       = x : filter p xs
  | otherwise = filter p xs
#+end_src

** The Foldr Function
Stands for folding for the right. Can define a number of functions.
#+begin_src haskell
f [] = v
f (x:xs) = x `oplus` f xs
#+end_src
f maps the empty list to a given value v, and any non-empty list to some arbitrary function `oplus`applied to its head and f of its tail.

Example:
#+begin_src haskell
sum []     = 0
sum (x:xs) = x + sum xs
#+end_src

Foldr encapsulates this pattern of recursion, give a function `oplus` and value v as arguments.
Example:
#+begin_src haskell
sum = foldr (+) 0
#+end_src

#+begin_src haskell
or = foldr (||) False
and = foldr (&&) True
#+end_src

*Definition (Foldr).*
#+begin_src haskell
foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldr f v []     = v
foldr f v (x:xs) = f x (foldr f v xs)
#+end_src

Can be thought non-recursively by replacing ":" by a given function and "[]" by a given value.
For example:
#+begin_src haskell
sum [1,2,3] = foldr (+) 0 [1,2,3] = foldr (+) (1:(2:(3:[])))
            = 1+(2+(3+0)) -- replace each (:) by (+) and [] by 0  
#+end_src  
    
More examples:
#+begin_src haskell
length = foldr (\_ n -> 1+n) 0
reverse = foldr (\x xs -> xs ++ [x]) []  
(++ ys) = foldr (:) ys    
#+end_src

Foldr simplifies the process of writing recursive functions on lists. The properties can be proved using algebraic properties, such as *fusion* and *banana split* rule.

** Other Library Functions
*Function composition:*
#+begin_src haskell
(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
f . g = \x -> f (g x)    
#+end_src

*All:* Every element of a list satisfies a given predicate.
*Any:* Any element of a list satisfies a given predicate.
#+begin_src haskell
all :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool
all p xs = and [p x | x <- xs]

any :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool
any p xs = or [p x | x <- xs]
any (== ' ') "abc def" -- checks if there's any whitespace in the string.
#+end_src

*takeWhile:* takes an element of a list while the predicate is satisfied.
#+begin_src haskell
takeWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
takeWhile p [] = []
takeWhile p (x:xs)
  | p x       = x : takeWhile p xs
  | otherwise = []
takeWhile (/=  ' ') "abc def" -- returns "abc"
#+end_src

*dropWhile:* drops elements while the predicate is satisfied.
#+begin_src haskell
dropWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
dropWhile p [] = []
dropWhile p (x:xs)
  | p x        = dropWhile p xs
  | otherwhise = x:xs
dropWhile (== ' ') "   abc" -- returns "abc"
#+end_src

Example: express `[f x | x <- xs, p x]` using map and filter.
#+begin_src haskell
map f (filter p xs)
#+end_src

* How To Think Recursively

Seven Steps:
1. Name the function
2. Write down its type #
3. Enumerate the cases #
4. Define the simple cases
5. List the "ingredients": what is available to solve the recursive case? 
6. Define the other cases
7. Think about the result: can it be generalized? #

Drops the first n elements of a list:
#+begin_src haskell
drop :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
drop 0 xs     = xs
drop _ []     = []
drop n (_:xs) = drop (n-1) xs
#+end_src

Removes the last element from a non-empty list:
#+begin_src haskell
init :: [a] -> [a]
init (x:xs) | null xs   = []
            | otherwise = x : init xs
#+end_src

#+begin_src haskell
init :: [a] -> [a]
init [_]    = []
init (x:xs) = x : init xs
#+end_src

* Declaring Types and Classes

** Type Declarations

Define functions, but declare types.
   
#+begin_src haskell
type String = [Char]
#+end_src

For example:

#+begin_src haskell
type Pos = (Int,Int)
origin :: Pos
origin = (0,0)

left :: Pos -> Pos 
left (x,y) = (x-1,y)
#+end_src

Can be nested, but cannot be recursive.

** Data Declaration

Is a completely new type.
   
#+begin_src haskell
data Bool = False | True
#+end_src

Here, False and True are *constructors* for the type Bool.
Type and constructor names must always begin with an upper-case letter.
Values of new types can be used like built in types.
Constructors can have parameters.

#+begin_src haskell
data Shape = Circle Float
           | Rect Float Float

square :: Float -> Shape
square n = Rect n n

area :: Shape -> Float
area (Circle r) = pi * r^2
area (Rect x y) = x * y
#+end_src

Here, the Circle and Shape constructors are functions that build values of the type Shape.

Data declarations can have parameters too.

#+begin_src haskell
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a

safediv :: Int -> Int -> Maybe Int
safediv _ 0 = Nothing
safediv m n = Just (m `div` n)

safehead :: [a] -> Maybe a
safehead [] = Nothing
safehead xs = Just (head xs)
#+end_src

*Maybe* is a safe way to define functions.

New types can be declared recursively.

#+begin_src haskell
data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat

nat2int :: Nat -> Int
nat2int Zero     = 0
nat2int (Succ n) = 1 + nat2int n

int2nat :: Int -> Nat
int2nat 0 = Zero
int2nat n = Succ (int2nat (n-1))

add Zero     n = n
add (Succ m) n = Succ (add m n)
#+end_src

** Tree-like Data Types

#+begin_src haskell
data Expr = Val Int
          | Add Expr Expr
          | Mul Expr Expr

Add (Val 1) (Mul (Val 2) (Val 3))

size :: Expr -> Int
size (Val n)   = 1
size (Add x y) = size x + size y
size (Mul x y) = size x + size y

eval :: Expr -> Int
eval (Val n)   = n
eval (Add x y) = eval x + eval y
eval (Mul x y) = eval x * eval y
#+end_src

#+begin_src haskell
eval = folde id (+) (*)
#+end_src

#+begin_src haskell
mult :: Nat -> Nat -> Nat
mult Zero     m = Zero
mult (Succ n) m = add (mult n m) m

data Tree a = Leaf a
            | Node (Tree a) (Tree a)
#+end_src

* Countdown Problem

Given six natural numbers, you can use four operations to find a given number.
